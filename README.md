# E06a-Particles-and-Screen-Shake

As with other exercises, Fork and Clone this repository.

This exercise gave me the opportunity to experiment with the Particles2D node in Godot and to try a script with which I was able implement screen shake. I created fire, rain, and sparkles for my particle effects.
